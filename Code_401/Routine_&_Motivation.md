#  Routine & Motivation

Once you graduate you will want to rest and find some type of normalcy. Of course, take a few days and sleep-in but only a few days. Normalcy is not on the menu until you find a new work home. Let's be honest here, you have lived 6 months with your house, laundry, errands, and fun on hold and those things still need to wait as "you' the "product" need to focus on getting a job. This task is equally as hard and is more important than anything else at this moment in your life. 

## Routine
