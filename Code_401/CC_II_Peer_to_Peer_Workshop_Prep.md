# Career Coaching Workshop II Prep

## The Science of Interviewing

Knowing the science behind the interview process makes the difference in winning vs. losing a job opportunity. It is a skill that needs to be honed and fine-tuned. 

Interviews are unique encounters with prospective employers that don't exist in everyday life. Meaning, where else do you find yourself being professionally vetted as a candidate on your emotional intelligence and technical skills in such a straightforward manner?

To help you unlock the formula of interviewing, you will participate in a workshop allowing you to conduct interviews, as well as be interviewed. This will give you the lens and perspective of being both a hiring manager and a candidate. 

Please look over the [Peer to Peer Mock Interview Guide](./Mock_Interview_Guide){:target="_blank"} to prepare for the workshop. During the workshop you will be playing the role of a recruiter and a candidate twice each. 

Steps to take to prepare for the day:
1. Make two copies of the [peer-to-peer interview spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yCEXYhzWTAcjcrRiE4QweKme0LhX8AovFpcosRduqHw/edit#gid=0){:target="_blank"} to prepare for playing the role of a recruiter twice. 
1. You will use one copy per each interview.
