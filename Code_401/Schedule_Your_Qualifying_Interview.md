# Qualifying Interview 

Congratulations, you are in the last stretch of an immersive learning program and completing courses with us. We are proud of you! You should be proud of you, too!

## The Next Phase

Job seeking time is here and now! The Qualifying Interview helps you meet the expectations of potential employers by mastering the interviewing process. Equally as important, you are required to pass this interview to qualify for the Career Accelerator program. The Career Accelerator program supports your efforts to get hired by connecting you with hiring partners through mock interviews, job fairs, hiring partners' happy hours, coupling you with valuable resources in the community and much more. A 90% is considered passing and if you score below this mark (which is considered failed) you are required to make the necessary corrections, and schedule another interview until you pass. Follow these steps to fully prepare for the interview. 

By scheduling your Qualifying Interview, you are notifying the Campus Director that **your materials are ready for review**. If your materials do not meet the required standards, you will be informed to align them to our guidelines and reschedule your interview.

Resumes will be reviewed prior to your scheduled interview date. You will either be approved to keep your interview or be asked to make changes to your materials before your scheduled time. If the new changes still do not meet the standard, you will need to reschedule your interview. Any questions feel free to slack the Campus Director. 

Schedule your interview for two weeks post-graduation. This will give you enough time to rest and prepare.

### Prepare for Your Qualifying Interview

Use the list below that outlines the expectations for professional etiquette and competency.

Potential employers are expecting you to answer in the **Star Method**, so prepare your responses in this manner.

1. Follow up
    * **Make sure to send a thank you note within 24 hours of the interview!**
