# Career Coaching Day III

## Presentation Day

Sharing your value to potential employers in a confident manner takes intentional practice. This assignment is designed to help you bring all of your career coaching assignments together in a cohesive way to build that self-assuredness.

## Assignment 

Write what you discovered about yourself through giving this presentation to your classmates, by sharing one key thing that you are proud of and one way to improve. 

Also share what resonated with you the most as a spectator, that made you feel connected to the presenter.

_We will allocate 6 hours of class time for this assignment_ 

_TA's will be grading on attendance to the workshop as well as submission of one thing you are proud of, one thing to improve on and something that resonated with you as a spectator._
