# Peer-to-Peer Mock Interview Guide

Mock interviews are designed to help you build articulate, pointed answers to use while in a job interview. Practicing with peers and receiving early feedback is the best way to prepare for the interview process. Learning about your interview skills—what works and what needs improvement—is vital before hitting the job market. Refine your interviewing skills in a safe and constructive place. When your nerves are high (and they will be) you’ll need your muscle memory to be your guide.

You will get to practice both as an interviewee (honing your delivery), and an interviewer (gaining understanding of what hiring managers are looking for). In this workshop, each person will play the role of the interviewer and interviewee twice.

To prepare for the mock interviews make sure all your materials are in alignment with the Code Fellows standards outlined in these links: [resume](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1JlbA8PBqRfC_Nj4hpyduIlPUar8YjT-GzgvSCaojojA/edit){:target="_blank"}, [LinkedIn](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QHDvGUTWYyxGt_x49SEiw5Z9vzsu5fCHgDeZgRWXKMs/edit#slide=id.g2bbea01bd4_0_206){:target="_blank"}, and [GitHub](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WcsrMvSdZe3XyshQ_z_O8A-tPwbUmiBUv_gT8hOPX50/edit#slide=id.g2bbea01bd4_0_233){:target="_blank"}. As an interviewer you will be expected to make sure your interviewee meets these standards. Interviews will last 30 minutes (5 minutes to review materials, 15 minutes for the interview, and 10 minutes to provide feedback).

These will be the four companies that you will either be representing or applying to during this mock interview. Make sure you come armed with their history, leaders names, their vision and mission, product knowledge, and why it would be great to work there.
1. Zillow
2. Expedia
3. F5
4. Avalara

Lastly, you will be asked technical and behavioral questions during the interview. To prepare for your behavioral questions make sure to use Star Method answers.
:star: STAR :star: is an acronym for four key concepts. Each concept is a step the job candidate can take to answer a behavioral interview question. By completing all four steps, the job candidate provides a thorough answer. The concepts in the acronym include:

1. Situation: Describe the context within which you performed a job or faced a challenge at work. For example, perhaps you were working on a group project, or you had a conflict with a coworker. This situation can be from a work experience, a volunteer position, or any other relevant event. Be as specific as possible.
2. Task: Next, describe your responsibility in that situation. Perhaps you had to help your group complete a project under a tight deadline, resolve a conflict with a coworker, or hit a sales target. 
3. Action: You then describe how you completed the task or endeavored to meet the challenge. Focus on what you did, rather than what your team, boss, or coworker did. (Tip: Instead of saying "We did xyx," say "I did xyz.") 
4. Result: Finally, explain the outcomes or results generated by the action taken. You might emphasize what you accomplished, or what you learned.
