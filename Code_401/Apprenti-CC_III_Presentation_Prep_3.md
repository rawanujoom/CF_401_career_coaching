Practice your entire presentation a few times. Time it, to ensure it's about 5 minutes long. Record a video of yourself presenting, and review it. 

Note: During presentations, there will be feedback on wins and ways to improve. Remember this is a safe place to receive feedback, share thoughtful insights, and encourage each other. The type of feedback given in this workshop is an exceptional zone to refine and improve your presentation skills preparing you for job opportunities and would not otherwise be accepted in a normal professional setting.
