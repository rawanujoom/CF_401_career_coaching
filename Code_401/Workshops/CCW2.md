## Learning Objectives

1. The student will refine their personal pitch to future employers through practice in front of an audience. 
2. The student will learn how to tie their previous career to becoming a software developer. 
3. The student will learn and understand the benefits behind practicing and memorizing their pitch when attending interviews, networking events, or socializing with others in the industry.

## Prep

2. Review the Career Coaching W2 assignments that are due for the students

## Lecture

Career Coaching Workshop 2 is all about the 60-second personal pitch.

1. [Personal Pitch Workshop](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f7SR9rVWjzRZrBjxrpVsfTX6UJJtVA21UB0e4pZL_cg/edit) slide deck
    - Alternate between the slide deck and the updating/revising their personal pitch. 
2. Pitch Practice
   - The amount of students you have will determine the amount of time you spend on this last part. Plan accordingly! Have each student recite their pitch in front of the class. Set a timer that goes off loudly after 1 minute. If they aren't done, they should conclude quickly. Open the floor to feedback from others for no more than 2 minutes. With transitions, it will take about 5 mintues for each student. Leave enough time to give everyone a chance for feedback, and get them out on time. 

## Notes

Encourage students to really highlight their prior skills learned into being a software developer. This is their opportunity to highlight their achievements, share with others what they are looking for, and what they have to offer. 

## General Comments

Use this time to discuss the Career Accelerator Program as well and the benefits of being in the program!
