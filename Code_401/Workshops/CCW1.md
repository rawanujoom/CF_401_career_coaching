Career Coaching Workshop 1 is all about perfecting the resume. 

1. [Resumes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P44qKnnjr93natpvpcR5wrBwvyDNWcHd1y-oUtg7UmQ/edit#slide=id.g3e590cf77e_2_53) slide deck (~ 3 hours)
    - Really encourage student interaction during the presentation. Encourage open discussions and questions from students to help them understand how they can tie in their past careers and skills into the tech industry.
    - Follow guidance in the Presenter Notes in the slides. 

## Notes

Students will have one of [these](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1f2dnx38bZdBwgzynjc374T_EKgQkYPCO) templates as a starting point. They MUST keep the formatting intact, while they replace the text with their specific verbiage. 

The more reivews on each resume the better. Students will work on their own resumes and review each other's resumes. If you have time, try and look over a few student resumes for a brief moment and provide feedback to the class, based on how well it is structured. Call out any and all typos, errors, or inconsistencies, as this will get a resume quickly rejected.
