# Networking Appointments 

Now that you have targeted your 1:1 informational coffee and event opportunity it is time to schedule them. Weekends are great for casual meetups and relaxing friendly events if weekdays and weeknights are too busy. Tip: invite your connections to your graduation day. 

Note:
1. Both need to be scheduled and attended before week 8. 
2. It is common courtesy when asking for a 1:1 that you pay the bill. Don't ask someone to coffee, pick their brain, and stick them with the check - not a good personal brand move.
