All the content needed for this assignment has already been created through previous Career Coaching assignments. Now pull it all together in this presentation as preparedness to land the job interview. 

Note: During presentations, there will be feedback on wins and ways to improve. Remember this is a safe place to receive feedback, share thoughtful insights, and encourage each other. The type of feedback given in this workshop is an exceptional zone to refine and improve your presentation skills preparing you for job opportunities and would not otherwise be accepted in a normal professional setting.  

_Allocate 30 minutes to this assignment_ 

_TA's will be grading you on your submission of the three slides._
