# Behavioral Interview Prep

Preparing for answers to common behavioral questions early is a **MUST**, because you **WILL** be asked these types of questions in the interview process. Your preparation is a vital step in becoming the lead candidate for any role. Your answers need development and curation time as muscle memory wins under stress. The more you practice and receive feedback, the better you sound when sharing your experiences.

## Highlight Positive Results

NOTE: Behavioral questions that involve tension situations (e.g. tell me a time when you worked with someone difficult, when did you make a mistake, or when did you disagree) should always have a good outcome. Never tell a story about an experience where you leave the interviewer thinking that someone was marginalized by you or a group. Instead, you want the interviewer to know that you handled a difficult situation and everyone lived happily ever after. Luckily, *you* get to choose the situation you will talk about!
