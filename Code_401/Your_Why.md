# Your Why 

## What is it? 

Your "why" is your passion and purpose in life. It separates you from everyone else and gives you focus and intention. Knowing your why gives you a huge advantage over candidates because you are empowered by it while driving your value in all conversations, intrinsically creating more opportunities. Sharing your why allows others to understand your value and how they can leverage it and relate to you.
