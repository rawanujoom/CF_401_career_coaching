# Career Coaching Workshop II

## Peer-to-Peer Mock Interview Workshop

Wow, great work today. What an experience it was to learn so much about your interview techniques and ways to improve to ensure that you win at the job interview process. 

## Assignment 

Write about your number one takeaway from interviewing a peer today. How does being on "the other side of the table" change your perspective on how you need to approach interviews?

Also write about at least two points of feedback your interviewer gave you during the workshop. What practical steps will you take to sharpen your interviewing skills? 

_We will allocate 3 hours of class time for this workshop_ 

_TA's will be grading you on your submission of one takeaway from interviewing and two points of feedback you received as well as practical steps you will take to improve._
